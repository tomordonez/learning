## Documenting summaries

Each book directory has either a single `Readme` file or a subdirectory `Code` and a `Readme` file. The purpose of the Readme file is not to copy excerpts from the books but to add general notes, observations, short lists, and lessons learned. Markdown is used lightly with at most two heading levels, strong/bold, bullet points, and code. The purpose of the Code directory is to apply what I read and expand the examples with my ideas.

* Branch name: Same as book directory
* Commit by chapter or part of a chapter: `Ch-Number Short summary` like `Ch1 Setup Scala`
