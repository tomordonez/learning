# 1. Classes and Objects

**Using classes as blueprints**

* Create a `Tree` class
  * Add an enum field for `treeType`
  * Add double fields for `heightFt`, `trunkDiameterInches`
  * Add a function `grow` that increases height by 10 and diameter by 1

**Building objects with a constructor**

* Create a `Tree` constructor
* Create a `Main` class
* Create a Tree instance
* Print the tree type
