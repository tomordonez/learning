# 1. Classes and Objects

**Using classes as blueprints**

* Create a `Tree` class
  * Add an enum field for `treeType`
  * Add double fields for `heightFt`, `trunkDiameterInches`
  * Add a function `grow` that increases height by 10 and diameter by 1

**Building objects with a constructor**

* Create a `Tree` constructor
* Create a `Main` class
* Create a Tree instance
* Print the tree type

**Using concrete instances for application logic**

* Print a message if the tree's height is > 100
* Create another tree instance, shorter, and wider
* Do another height comparison
* Create a function in `Tree` to print if a tree is tall (greater than 100 ft)

**Class vs instance members**

* Instance members are not static, must be accessed from the object's instance
* Class members are static, they are accessed from the class, not from an instance
* Create a class member of type `Color` with reference variable in uppercase
* In `Main` access the color attribute
* Create a static method in `Tree` to print out a message

**Built-in Java class**
**Build an employee class**
