## Discover data analysis

**Introduction**

* Tell stories with data
* Building data culture
* Facilitate trusted business decisions
* Understand the meaning of metrics

**Overview of data analysis**

What is data analysis?

* Identify, clean, transform, and model data
* Craft data into a story through reports
* Support decision-making process

Analytics categories:

`Descriptive`
* Answer questions based on historical data
* Develop KPIs to track success/failure
* Generate reports to view organization data

`Diagnostic`
* Answer questions to reason why events happened
* Identify anomalies in descriptive analytics data
* Collect related data and use statistical analysis to discover relationships/trends

`Predictive`
* Answer questions to what might happen in the future
* Use historical data and statistical or ML techniques

`Prescriptive`
* Answer questions about which actions to take to achieve a goal
* Use historical data and ML to find patterns

`Cognitive`
* Make inferences based on existing knowledge
* Add findings into self learning feedback loop
* Use unstructured data expressed in degrees of confidence
* Use ML and NLP to process data

**Roles in data**

`Business analyst`
* Similar to data analyst
* Focused on interpreting data from visualizations

`Data analyst`
* Visualization and reporting tools
* ETL (for visualization)
* Design/build scalable data models
* Partner with stakeholders to get requirements
* Manage PBI assets (reports, dashboards, workspaces, datasets) and set security process.
* Partner with data engineer to locate data sources
* Partner with DB admin to get access to data sources

`Data engineer`
* Provision and set up data platform on-prem and cloud
* Manage flow of structured and unstructured data
* Data platform: relational, nonrelational, data stream, file stores
* ETL (to integrate data)

`Data scientist`
* Extract value from data using statistics and ML
* Descriptive with EDA
* Predictive with experiments using ML

`Database administrator`
* Availability and performance of database solutions
* Manage access controls, backup, recovery plans

**Tasks of a data analyst**

`Prepare`
* Profile, clean, and transform data
* Turn raw data into information that is trusted and understandable
  * Data integrity
  * Correct wrong or inaccurate data
  * Identify missing data
  * Convert data from one structure to another
  * Make data more readable
* How to get/connect to data and performance implications
* Strategy for privacy and security
  * Anonymize data or protecting personally identifiable data

`Model`
* Define/create relationships between the tables
* Define metrics and custom calculations to enrich the data
* Makes reports more accurate, allows data to be explored faster
* Decreases time for report writing process
* In PBI, if report is slow to perform/refresh, revisit data preparation and model

`Visualize`
* Understand the problem domain
* Build reports and visualizations

`Analyze`
* Communicate stories to discover insights
* In PBI, use AI features to answer questions/get insights

`Manage`
* Manage PBI assets: reports, dashboards, workspaces, dataset
* Distribute and secure assets
* Use Apps for distribution

## Get started building with Power BI

**Intro**

* Parts of PBI
  * PBI Desktop
  * PBI Service (view reports online)
  * PBI native apps
* Download PBI
  * Windows Store App (auto updates)
  * Download from web (manual updates)

**Use PBI**

* Create report in PBI desktop
* Publish to PBI service and shared
* Consumers view reports on web or mobile apps

**Building blocks for PBI**

`Visualizations`
* Simple or complex representation of data
* Present data to provide context and insights

`Datasets`
* Collection of data to create visualizations
* One or many sources combined
  * For example: 3 dataset fields, one website table, an Excel table
* Filter to focus on specific data
  * Visualize data based on subset

`Reports`
* Collection of visualizations in one or more pages

`Dashboards`
* Share reports/visualization collections with (one-page canvas) dashboards
* Share with other users/groups that can interact with the dashboard

`Tiles`
* Rectangular box, holding a visual on a dashboard

**Use the PBI service**

* `Apps`: Pre-packaged visuals/presets/reports when connecting a data source
  * An app could be connecting to your Github account (or other sources)
  * Or an app pre-packaged by your organization
* Create a Github dashboard
  * Get data
  * Services/Get
  * Select Github and authenticate
  * Explore dashboard and reports
* Update data
  * Go to the dataset and update now or schedule
