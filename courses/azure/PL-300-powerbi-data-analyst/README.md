## Discover data analysis

**Introduction**

* Tell stories with data
* Building data culture
* Facilitate trusted business decisions
* Understand the meaning of metrics

**Overview of data analysis**

What is data analysis?

* Identify, clean, transform, and model data
* Craft data into a story through reports
* Support decision-making process

Analytics categories:

`Descriptive`
* Answer questions based on historical data
* Develop KPIs to track success/failure
* Generate reports to view organization data

`Diagnostic`
* Answer questions to reason why events happened
* Identify anomalies in descriptive analytics data
* Collect related data and use statistical analysis to discover relationships/trends

`Predictive`
* Answer questions to what might happen in the future
* Use historical data and statistical or ML techniques

`Prescriptive`
* Answer questions about which actions to take to achieve a goal
* Use historical data and ML to find patterns

`Cognitive`
* Make inferences based on existing knowledge
* Add findings into self learning feedback loop
* Use unstructured data expressed in degrees of confidence
* Use ML and NLP to process data

**Roles in data**

`Business analyst`
* Similar to data analyst
* Focused on interpreting data from visualizations

`Data analyst`
* Visualization and reporting tools
* ETL (for visualization)
* Design/build scalable data models
* Partner with stakeholders to get requirements
* Manage PBI assets (reports, dashboards, workspaces, datasets) and set security process.
* Partner with data engineer to locate data sources
* Partner with DB admin to get access to data sources

`Data engineer`
* Provision and set up data platform on-prem and cloud
* Manage flow of structured and unstructured data
* Data platform: relational, nonrelational, data stream, file stores
* ETL (to integrate data)

`Data scientist`
* Extract value from data using statistics and ML
* Descriptive with EDA
* Predictive with experiments using ML

`Database administrator`
* Availability and performance of database solutions
* Manage access controls, backup, recovery plans

**Tasks of a data analyst**

`Prepare`
* Profile, clean, and transform data
* Turn raw data into information that is trusted and understandable
  * Data integrity
  * Correct wrong or inaccurate data
  * Identify missing data
  * Convert data from one structure to another
  * Make data more readable
* How to get/connect to data and performance implications
* Strategy for privacy and security
  * Anonymize data or protecting personally identifiable data

`Model`
* Define/create relationships between the tables
* Define metrics and custom calculations to enrich the data
* Makes reports more accurate, allows data to be explored faster
* Decreases time for report writing process
* In PBI, if report is slow to perform/refresh, revisit data preparation and model

`Visualize`
* Understand the problem domain
* Build reports and visualizations

`Analyze`
* Communicate stories to discover insights
* In PBI, use AI features to answer questions/get insights

`Manage`
* Manage PBI assets: reports, dashboards, workspaces, dataset
* Distribute and secure assets
* Use Apps for distribution
