# Intro

This repo contains:
* `gatech`: Summary of courses I am taking at Gatech (only what I can publish publicly to meet honor code)
* `courses`: Summary of courses I am taking, including code and documentation.
* `reading`: Summary of books I am reading.
* `docs`: Documentation/tutorials to set up courses.

My blog also has documentation/tutorials of topics I learned. [Tom Ordonez Blog](https://www.tomordonez.com/)

## Experience

**Gatech**

* Software Architecture (in progress)
  * Java, UML, architecture styles, design patterns
    * Also studying: JUnit, JDBC, Data structures, Spring, React
    * Also reading: Clean Code, The Clean Coder, Working with Legacy Code

* Software Development
  * SDLC, Java, JUnit, Test driven development
  * Worked in a team to build an Android app using Java, Android Studio, and Git

* Data Analytics
  * Python/Pandas, Java, Scala, JavaScript, Hadoop, Spark, AWS
  * Processed data using Java/Hadoop/AWS and built data pipelines to connect to APIs using Python. Built data visualizations with JavaScript and Tableau. Launched machine learning models in AWS and Azure.
  * Worked in a team to write a research paper about NLP sentiment analysis.

* Database Design
  * Data modeling with entity relationship diagrams, class diagrams, SQL
  * Worked in a team to build a dashboard using C# and SQL

* AI Ethics
  * Studied fairness of machine learning algorithms by analyzing use cases and datasets with Python, Pandas, and Numpy

* Human Computer Interaction
  * Wrote extensive research documentation on UX research and agile development.

**Work**

* Built a dashboard for a supply chain team to find competitors near fulfillment centers (Python, GCP, PowerBI)
* Built a dashboard for a talent team to track efforts in diversity recruiting (SQL, PowerBI)
* Built an internal web app to automate delivery of talent pipelines. (Python, SQL, Bash, Power Automate)

**Personal**

Projects I want to build:

* Web app dashboard to show my experience with data engineering
  * Tech stack: Backend (Python or Java, PySpark, SQL), Frontend (React), Deployment (Airflow, Terraform, K8s, AWS)
* One-page web apps with calculators
  * A better version of what you see online without all the annoying ads

## Learning

* Why Java?
  * My current Gatech class is in Java, and it expects OOP, DB, and application experience
* Why Python and SQL?
  * I want to increase skills in data engineering
* Why AWS and Azure?
  * Because everything is in the cloud now
* Why JS?
  * Everything UI is JS or it uses dashboard software
