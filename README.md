## Documenting

* Each topic has a directory with a `README` and `Code` directory
* Create a branch with the topic name or a combination of technology and topic
    initials. For example 'Building Modern Projects with React', the branch
    could be `react-BMP`.
* Commit and push the branch.
* Create a Github PR, merge to main, don't delete branch.

**CLI**

    (main)$ git checkout -b react-BMP
    (react-BMP)$ git add .
    (react-BMP)$ git commit -m "a message..."
    (react-BMP)$ git push -u origin react-BMP
    (react-BMP)$ git checkout main
    (main)$ git pull

**IntelliJ**

* Bottom right, click on `main`, click New Branch
* Make changes
* Left margin, click on tab `commit`
* Select files under Changes and Unversioned files
* `Ctrl+K` or right click select Commit
* Enter a message
* Top menu Git/Push
