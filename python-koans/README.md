# Python Koans

**Setup**

* Git clone repo `git clone https://github.com/8thlight/python_koans`
* Install `sniffer`
  * `pip install sniffer`
  * `pip install pyinotify`
* Add to PATH (this is not persistent, unless you edit `~/.bashrc`)
  * `export PATH="/home/tom/.local/bin:$PATH"`
* Go to the source directory
  * `cd python3`
* Run `sniffer`
  * It depends on the file `python_koans/python3/scent.py`
* Modify the file(s) with errors. In the terminal, see the tests changing.

**Koan**

What is a Koan? According to Wikipedia "...a dialogue, question, or statement, used to provoke the great doubt and to practice or test a student's progress in Zen."

**My python-koans directory**

I only committed to my `python-koans` directory, the files I changed in `python3/koans/`. To see all the original repo code go to [https://github.com/8thlight/python_koans](https://github.com/8thlight/python_koans)

## AboutAsserts

File: `koans/about_asserts.py`

These were basic tests to `self.assertTrue`, `self.assertEqual`, and `assert`
